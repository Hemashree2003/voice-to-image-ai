# voice-to-image-ai
 Description: A deep learning project that generates images from spoken audio descriptions.
This project is a deep learning pipeline that transforms spoken audio into a unique, AI-generated image. It uses a combination of advanced speech recognition and generative vision models to create a seamless voice-to-art experience
Features:
          Live audio recording directly in the browser.
          Speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model.
          Image generation using Stable Diffusion v1.5.
          Interactive web UI built with Gradio.
How to Run:
            1. Clone the repository.
            2. Open the final_app.ipynb file in Google Colab.
            3. Ensure the runtime is set to use a T4 GPU.
            4. Run all cells.
